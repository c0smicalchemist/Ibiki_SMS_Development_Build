==========================================
DEPLOYMENT FIXED - READ THIS
==========================================

The permission denied error was caused by the script trying to create 
/opt/ibiki-sms even in "in-place" mode.

THIS HAS BEEN FIXED!

==========================================
FIXED DEPLOYMENT PACKAGE
==========================================

File: ibiki-sms-deployment.tar.gz (updated with fix)

The script now properly deploys in-place from /root without touching /opt.

==========================================
DEPLOYMENT STEPS (UPDATED)
==========================================

1. CLEAN UP OLD DEPLOYMENT (if you tried before)
   
   SSH into your server:
   ssh root@151.243.109.79
   
   Remove old files:
   cd /root
   rm -rf ibiki-sms
   rm -f ibiki-sms-deployment.tar.gz

2. UPLOAD NEW PACKAGE
   
   Download: ibiki-sms-deployment.tar.gz from Replit
   
   Upload to server:
   scp ibiki-sms-deployment.tar.gz root@151.243.109.79:/root/

3. EXTRACT AND DEPLOY
   
   ssh root@151.243.109.79
   cd /root
   tar -xzf ibiki-sms-deployment.tar.gz -C ibiki-sms
   cd ibiki-sms
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   sudo ./deploy.sh

4. DEPLOYMENT WILL SUCCEED
   
   No more permission errors!
   Application will deploy to /root/ibiki-sms/
   
==========================================
WHAT WAS FIXED
==========================================

Before: Script defaulted INSTALL_DIR="/opt/ibiki-sms" 
        even when DEPLOY_IN_PLACE=true

After:  Script sets INSTALL_DIR="$(pwd)" when DEPLOY_IN_PLACE=true
        No /opt directory created or accessed

==========================================
ACCESS YOUR APP
==========================================

After deployment completes:
http://151.243.109.79

First signup becomes admin automatically!
